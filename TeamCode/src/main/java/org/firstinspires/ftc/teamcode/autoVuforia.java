/**
 * This OpMode illustrates the basics of using the Vuforia localizer to determine
 * positioning and orientation of robot on the FTC field.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * Vuforia uses the phone's camera to inspect it's surroundings, and attempt to locate target images.
 *
 * When images are located, Vuforia is able to determine the position and orientation of the
 * image relative to the camera.  This sample code than combines that information with a
 * knowledge of where the target images are on the field, to determine the location of the camera.
 *
 * This example assumes a "diamond" field configuration where the red and blue alliance stations
 * are adjacent on the corner of the field furthest from the audience.
 * From the Audience perspective, the Red driver station is on the right.
 * The two vision target are located on the two walls closest to the audience, facing in.
 * The Stones are on the RED side of the field, and the Chips are on the Blue side.
 *
 * A final calculation then uses the location of the camera on the robot to determine the
 * robot's location and orientation on the field.
 *
 * @see VuforiaLocalizer
 * @see VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener
 * see  ftc_app/doc/tutorial/FTC_FieldCoordinateSystemDefinition.pdf
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: In order to use this OpMode, you need to obtain your own Vuforia license key as
 * is explained below.

         * Once you've obtained a license key, copy the string form of the key from the Vuforia web site
         * and paste it in to your code as the value of the 'vuforiaLicenseKey' field of the
         * {@link Parameters} instance with which you initialize Vuforia.
